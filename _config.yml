  새로운 것을 학습하는 것이 즐겁고 개발하는 것이 재미있는 서울에 살고 있는 주니어 백엔드 개발자 김현기입니다
  
  💡 제가 가장 어필하고 싶은 개인 역량은 오류를 즐기는 자세입니다.
  
  프로젝트를 진행하면서 오류가 발생하면,
  당황하는 대신 어디서 발생했는지 그리고 가장 가능성이 높은 원인은 무엇인지부터 생각합니다.
  
  실수를 방지하는 것이 아니라 관리하는 것이 중요하다고 말씀하셨습니다.
  저는 이 말에 대해 굉장히 동의합니다.
  
  앞으로 동일한 오류가 발생해도, 답이 없는 오류가 아니라면,
  어디서 실수했는지 판단하고 어떻게 해결할 수 있는지 생각해볼 수 있기 때문입니다.
  
  이러한 오류를 즐기고 발생 원인을 이해하고 관리하기 위해 노력하며 개발하려 노력합니다.
  
  저는 이러한 오류에 대처하는 역량과 스스로 일을 즐길 수 있는 마인드를 가지고, 회사의 일을 제 일과 같이 여기며 즐기며 일하겠습니다!

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
